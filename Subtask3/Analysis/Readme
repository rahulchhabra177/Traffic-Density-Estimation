This folder primarily consists of the report of the entire assignment along with the graphs, tables and
output files. It also contains auxiliary scripts for extra functions.

Particularly, the "Analysis" folder contains:

1)A folder named Outputs which contains:
	
	a)The output .csv files we obtained during the execution of our methods implemented in "Code" b) 
	folder. 
	
	b)The graphs of queue density vs frame for each test-case using the script plot.py
	
	c)A script called plot.py which takes the data from the .csv files and plots them using gnuplot
	This script can be executed from command line using "python plot.py"
	
Output File naming convention: out<method-number><testcase-number>.csv 

Graph naming convention: Method<method-number>-<testcase-number>.png
	
2)A folder called UtilityFunction which is useful for trade-off analysis. It contains:

	a)A script called util.py which takes the output files as input and produce utility values for 
	each of the test cases of every method. This script can be executed from command line 
	using "python plot.py".
	
	b)Four output files containing the utility values obtaining by the above script for each of the
	methods.
	
	c)The utility-runtime tradeoff graphs for each of the methods.   

3)A report of the entire assignment including the description and implementation of the original code 
as well as all the additional methods and their analysis. This analysis includes trade-off analysis and 
CPU usage as well.

4)A file called "Runtimes" which summarises the execution times of all the test cases.
