The contents of this folder have been prepared by Shrey Patel(2019CS10400) and Rahul Chhabra(2019CS11016)

The folder contains four essential things:

1) C++ code using OpenCV, named video.cpp, which takes in a sample video and outputs the values of framenum, queue density, dynamic density in the command line

2) Image of Graph we obtained during execution in our machine whose X axis represents the number of frame and Y axis represents the density.

3)The file out.txt which contains the data using which the graph is plotted.

4) The cmake file CMakeLists.txt which contains cmake code to generate the makefile.


--How to setup the Makefile?
Run the command "cmake CMakeLists.txt" to build various cmake files along with the required Makefile which will help us to build our cpp files.
	
--How to compile?
Type "make all" in command line to build the executable "video". The cmake files take care of linking all the associated OpenCV packages and libraries.

--How to run the executable?
To execute "video" file, type "./video" in the command line followed by the video you want to input. For e.g. "./video trafficvideo.mp4"


--Notes
1) The build files can be cleaned from the directory by typing "make clean" in command line.

2) Double quotes in this document are not to be literally typed in command line, they have been used to separate actual commands from plain text.

3) Any failure to follow the above steps for compilation/running/providing input will be accompanied by an error message which will instruct/suggest the correct procedure. 

4) The execution of code takes time equal to length of video file provided.
